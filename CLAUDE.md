# Tracker — Project Context

## What this is
A dead-simple personal habit/quantity tracker. The user adds their own trackers
("Standard drinks", "Chia seeds", "Went outside", "Weight", "Night routine")
that are **yes/no** (did it or not), **count** (how many in a day), **measure**
(a free-form numeric reading like weight, latest replaces), or **series** (an
ordered checklist of steps that resets daily). They tap to log, see a
**calendar** of which days, and a few **analytics** (streaks, totals, a 30-day
chart). Every day is editable after the fact and can carry a free-text note.
The guiding spirit: a private, honest, low-friction personal tool.

## Local workspace
This repo lives at **`C:\Users\snoww\Mapper-Tracker\tracker\`** — a gitignored subfolder of the user's `Mapper-Tracker` workspace (renamed from `Map` → `Mapper + Tracker` → `Mapper-Tracker`; the `+`/space in the old name broke Turbopack's `next dev` HMR — keep the path free of `+`/spaces), which is itself the `personal-site` portfolio repo. The sibling **MapCrowd** app (`../mapcrowd/`, github `snowwarrior1-alt/Mapper`) is a separate repo in the same workspace, and the two **share one Supabase project** (named "Mapper+Tracker", ref `tmycdgnofvmbyrmpqohw`) — see Deployment.

## Tech stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack), all pages are `'use client'`
- **DB + Auth**: Supabase (Postgres, RLS, Google OAuth)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 (`@import "tailwindcss"`, CSS vars in `globals.css`)
- **Icons**: lucide-react
- **Language**: TypeScript
- Mirrors the **MapCrowd** project's stack and conventions (sibling repo).

## Running locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:3000
npm run build    # production build check
npm test         # vitest — unit tests for lib/stats.ts (pure logic)
```
`.env.local` needs (Supabase dashboard → Settings → API):
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<project>.supabase.co   # MUST include https://
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
```
**Build-time env**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars are inlined at *build* time, and
`lib/supabase.ts` throws at module load if they're missing — so the build fails
without them. For a CI/clean build without real creds, pass dummy values:
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://dummy.supabase.co NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=dummy npm run build`.

## Data model
| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `trackers` | One per tracked thing: `user_id` (owner), name, `type` (`yesno`/`count`), `color`, `emoji`, `unit?`, `goal_direction` (`more`/`less`/`neutral`), `streak_side` (`did`/`skipped` — which side the streak counts), `sort_order`, `archived`, `created_at`. |
| `entries` | One row per tap: `user_id`, `tracker_id`, `day` (LOCAL date), `value` (**numeric** — measures store decimals). A count day = `SUM(value)`; a yes/no day = "done" if any row exists; a **measure** day = one row holding the reading (latest replaces). |
| `day_notes` | Optional note, unique per (`tracker_id`, `day`): `user_id`, `note`, `updated_at`. |
| `tracker_resources` | Reference material attached to a tracker (not a day): `kind` (`link`/`note`), optional `title`, `url` (links), `body` (notes), `sort_order`. A check enforces link⇒url, note⇒body. |
| `sections` | Dashboard groups: `title`, `sort_order`, `collapsed` (synced). `trackers.section_id` → `sections.id` (`on delete set null` → ungrouped). |
| `tracker_steps` | Steps of a `series` tracker: `tracker_id`, `label`, `sort_order`. A checked step is an `entries` row with `step_id` set (day total = # steps done). |

- **RLS**: every table is `for all to authenticated using (auth.uid() = user_id)
  with check (auth.uid() = user_id)`. The `user_id` columns **default to
  `auth.uid()`**, so client inserts don't pass `user_id` — it's filled from the
  JWT, and the check passes. To add a column/table, keep this pattern.
- **Migrations**: fresh project → run `schema.sql` (full state). Existing DB →
  run only the numbered files not yet applied, in order. `schema.sql` is kept in
  sync as the union of all migrations.

## Key conventions & gotchas
- **Day keys are LOCAL, not UTC.** `lib/date.ts` `toDayKey()`/`todayKey()` format
  `YYYY-MM-DD` in the browser's local timezone so a late-night tap lands on the
  right day. Never send `new Date().toISOString()` as a day. The `day` column is
  a Postgres `date`.
- **Editing any day reuses the same writers.** `db.ts` `addEntry`/`removeLastEntry`/
  `clearDay` all take a `day` arg; the "today" logger and the calendar `DayEditor`
  call the same `adjust(day, delta)` / `setDone(day, done)` handlers in
  `app/t/[id]/page.tsx`. Local `entries` state is mutated optimistically and a
  `busy` flag guards against double-submits while a write is in flight.
- **Analytics `since`** = the tracker's created day, or the earliest entry day if
  earlier (so honest backfilling counts). Computed in the detail page.
- **Streak side** (`trackers.streak_side`): `'did'` streaks on days you logged it
  (`total > 0`), `'skipped'` on clean days (`total === 0`). It's **independent of
  `goal_direction`** (which still drives the calendar tint + the "good/clean/active
  days" tile). Default at creation comes from the goal (`defaultStreakSide`: `less`
  → `skipped`, else `did`); the detail page's "Streak counts" toggle flips it live
  via `updateTracker`. Streak math (`currentStreak`/`longestStreak`) takes the side,
  not the goal. App code reads `tracker.streak_side ?? defaultStreakSide(...)` so it
  still works against rows from before migration 04.
- **Chart ranges**: `Analytics` lets you pick week / month / year / all / custom
  (date pickers). `stats.buildBuckets(totals, start, end)` auto-picks a
  `Granularity` (`chooseGranularity`: ≤45 days daily, ≤366 weekly, else monthly) so
  the bar count stays phone-readable. **Note callouts only render on daily bars** (a
  week/month bucket has no single note day). Callouts mark interior strict local
  max (`▲`) / min (`▼`) bars that have a `day_notes` note, shown on hover (desktop)
  or tap (mobile).
- **Editing tracker settings** all go through `db.ts` `updateTracker(id, patch)`
  (patches `name`/`color`/`emoji`/`unit`/`goal_direction`/`streak_side`). The
  detail header's icon tile is a button → inline emoji picker (same `EMOJIS`
  palette as the create modal) that calls `changeEmoji`, persisting optimistically
  with rollback on error — the same pattern as the streak-side toggle. `name`,
  `color`, and `unit` are patchable too but have no UI yet.
- **Dashboard ordering** is `trackers.sort_order` asc (then `created_at`).
  `listTrackers` reads it; the dashboard's up/down arrows swap two rows and
  persist `sort_order = list position` via `updateTracker` for every row whose
  position changed (optimistic, reverts on failure). The column predates this —
  no migration needed.
- **Sections** (`sections` table, [`SectionHeader`](components/SectionHeader.tsx)):
  optional collapsible groups on the dashboard. Trackers reference one via
  `section_id` (null = **ungrouped, rendered first** with no header). The
  dashboard groups `trackers` by `section_id`; **up/down arrows reorder within a
  group** (`moveTracker` swaps the in-group neighbour, then persists global
  `sort_order`); assignment is a `<select>` on each card (`assignSection` →
  `updateTracker({ section_id })`). `collapsed` is a **synced** column (toggling
  writes it). Section CRUD/reorder live in `db.ts` (`createSection`/`updateSection`/
  `deleteSection`); deleting a section ungroups its trackers (FK `on delete set
  null`). `listSections` tolerates a missing table (migration 07).
- **"Days since" hint** (dashboard card): `daysBetween(lastDay, today)` where
  `lastDay` comes from `db.ts` `listLatestEntries()` (latest `{day, value}` per
  tracker; pulls `(tracker_id, day, value)` for the user and keeps the first of a
  `day desc` sort). Hidden when logged today (covered by `todayTotal`) or never
  logged. It re-resolves from `todayTotal` automatically once you log today.
- **Measure trackers** (`type: 'measure'`, e.g. weight): a free-form numeric
  reading per day, **latest replaces** (one entry/day) via `db.ts` `setDayValue`
  (clear the day + insert one). Entry is a number field on the dashboard card,
  the detail Today logger, and `DayEditor` — all reject blank/0/NaN. `entries.value`
  is `numeric`; `db.ts` `toEntry` coerces it to a JS number (PostgREST can return
  numeric as a string). Analytics swap the count/streak tiles for **latest /
  average / lowest / highest** (`summarizeMeasure`), the chart **averages** each
  bucket (`buildBuckets(..., 'avg')`) and scales bars from a baseline below the
  min so small changes show. Streak side is hidden (a 0 day isn't "clean" for a
  measure); the calendar tints logged days uniformly rather than by amount/goal.
  Display values go through `lib/format.ts` `fmtNum`.
- **Tracker resources** (`tracker_resources`, [`ResourcesSection`](components/ResourcesSection.tsx)):
  links + notes attached to a tracker, on the detail page below the Today logger.
  **Link URLs go through `lib/url.ts` `normalizeUrl`** — bare domains get
  `https://`, and only `http:`/`https:` are allowed (javascript:/data:/file:/…
  are rejected) since the value becomes a `target="_blank"` href. Links render
  with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`. The section self-loads via `listResources`,
  which (like the notes readers) **tolerates a missing table** so the page still
  works before migration 05 is applied — but adds/edits fail until it is.
- **Series trackers** (`type: 'series'`, e.g. a night routine): an ordered
  checklist of `tracker_steps` that **resets daily**. A checked step is an
  `entries` row tagged with `step_id` (so a day's total = # steps done, and
  series reuses count-style calendar/analytics). `lib/stats.ts` `seriesProgress`
  computes done/total/next/complete. Dashboard card: the big button
  (`onCheckNext`) checks the next unchecked step in order; **tapping the card
  expands an inline `StepChecklist`** (out-of-order); **right-click / long-press
  (~500ms) opens a hold-menu** (reveal checklist / reset today / mark all done /
  open page). Steps are created in `AddTrackerModal` and managed on the detail
  page (`StepsManager`); `DayEditor` shows the checklist for a past day. Series
  forces `goal_direction: 'more'` and `streak_side: 'did'` (no goal/streak UI).
- **`listNotes`/`listResources` tolerate a missing table** via the shared
  `isMissingTable` helper in `db.ts` (matches `42P01`/`PGRST205`/the table name),
  so the detail page still loads if migration 03 or 05 lags a deploy.
- **Auth is client-side, like MapCrowd** — `signInWithOAuth({ provider: 'google',
  options: { redirectTo: window.location.origin } })`, no server callback route.
  `useUser()` reads `getSession()` + subscribes to `onAuthStateChange`. Both pages
  gate on it (spinner → SignInScreen → content). The redirect origin MUST be in
  Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs or sign-in fails.
- **Security headers** live in [`next.config.ts`](next.config.ts) `headers()` and
  apply to every route: `X-Frame-Options: DENY` + CSP `frame-ancestors 'none'`
  (anti-clickjacking), `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`,
  `Permissions-Policy`, and HSTS. A full script/style/connect CSP is the next
  step but must be validated against the live Google OAuth + Supabase flow first
  (a wrong directive locks users out). Security model overall: client-only SPA,
  **RLS is the boundary** (every table `auth.uid() = user_id`), the anon key is
  public by design, and all user text (incl. notes) renders as escaped JSX.
- **Mobile-first.** Tap targets are kept ≥44px; modals are bottom sheets
  (`items-end ... sm:items-center`, `rounded-t-2xl`) that dismiss on backdrop tap;
  the floating Add button uses `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` (needs
  `viewport-fit=cover`, set in `layout.tsx`).

## Verifying changes
- `npm run build` (with real or dummy env) + `npm test` should both pass.
- The app is auth-gated, so previewing signed-in screens needs a session. The
  pattern used during development: create a throwaway user via the GoTrue admin
  API (service-role key, `email_confirm:true`), password-grant a session, inject
  it into the browser's `localStorage` under `sb-<ref>-auth-token`, then delete
  the user after. (Supabase uses rotating ES256 JWT keys — a freshly minted token
  can briefly 401 with "no suitable key" until the JWKS cache catches up; refresh
  or retry.)

## Deployment
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/snowwarrior1-alt/Tracker (Vercel auto-deploys `main`)
- **Live**: https://dailytally.vercel.app
- **Supabase**: shares MapCrowd's project — named **"Mapper+Tracker"**
  (`tmycdgnofvmbyrmpqohw`) — to stay under the free-tier 2-project cap. Tracker
  only owns the `trackers`/`entries`/`day_notes` tables; its RLS doesn't touch
  MapCrowd data. Google OAuth + the Google callback are already configured at the
  project level.
- **Vercel env vars**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`,
  set for all environments. Must exist *before* a build (inlined at build time).

## Features built
- Add trackers (yes/no or count; emoji, color, unit, goal direction, streak side)
- Tap-to-log on the dashboard; per-tracker detail with today logger
- Month calendar tinted by goal direction; note dots
- Analytics: current/longest streak, good/clean days, totals, 7/30-day sums
- **Adjustable chart range**: week / month / year / all / custom, auto-bucketed
  daily → weekly → monthly to stay readable
- **Choosable streak side** ("did it" vs "skipped"), set at creation and flippable
  on the detail page
- **Editable icon** — tap the detail-page header tile to pick a new emoji (persists
  via `updateTracker`)
- **Reorderable dashboard** — up/down arrows on each card move trackers and
  persist `sort_order`
- **"Days since last logged" hint** — a subtle clock badge on each dashboard card
  when a tracker hasn't been logged today
- **Tracker resources** — attach titled links (e.g. a routine doc) and free-text
  notes to a tracker, on its detail page (needs migration `05-resources.sql`)
- **Measure tracker type** — free-form numeric readings (e.g. weight), latest
  replaces per day, with latest/avg/min/max + trend chart (needs migration
  `06-measure.sql`, which also makes `entries.value` numeric)
- **Dashboard sections** — collapsible groups (title + thin rule); assign via a
  per-card picker, reorder within a group, collapse state synced (needs migration
  `07-sections.sql`)
- **Series tracker type** — a daily-resetting checklist of steps (e.g. a routine)
  with an advance button, inline checklist, and a hold/right-click menu (needs
  migration `08-series.sql`)
- **Edit any past day** via a calendar-tap bottom sheet (adjust value / toggle)
- **Per-day notes**, with peak/dip **note callouts** on the daily chart; today's
  note is also editable inline from each **dashboard card** (`listNotesForDay`)
- Google sign-in, per-user data (RLS)
- Mobile-tuned (tap targets, bottom sheets, safe-area)
